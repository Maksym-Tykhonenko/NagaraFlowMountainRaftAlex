    nagaraarticle: `Packing right can turn a nervous first trip into a smooth adventure. Start with layers: quick-drying clothes, a light waterproof jacket, and secure shoes that won’t slip when wet. Cotton is your enemy on the river — it stays wet and cold far too long.

Keep essentials small and waterproofed. A dry bag for your phone, keys, and snacks will save you stress later. Don’t forget sunscreen and a refillable water bottle — dehydration happens faster than you expect.

Above all, travel light. The less you carry, the easier you move. Your balance and freedom matter more than an extra hoodie or towel.`,

    nagaratitle: 'Choosing the Right Boat',
    nagaraarticle: `Not every raft is the same, and knowing your type makes the ride feel natural.
Inflatable rafts are the classic — stable, safe, and perfect for groups or beginners. Kayaks give more control but require skill and quick reflexes. Catarafts, with their twin-tube design, are for thrill-seekers who enjoy agility.

Match the boat to the river. Calm, open routes like the Tuckasegee love wide rafts. Tight, twisting water like the Green River Narrows needs something smaller and responsive.

Ask yourself: do you want to enjoy the view or test your reflexes? The answer will choose your craft for you.`,

    nagaratitle: 'Safety Basics',
    nagaraarticle: `Even calm rivers demand respect. Safety isn’t about fear — it’s about confidence.
Always wear a certified life jacket and helmet. They’re not optional, even on easy runs. Learn the universal signals: paddle raised means “stop,” tapping the head means “I’m okay.”

Never stand in fast-moving water; your foot can trap between rocks. If you fall out, float on your back with feet forward until the current calms — you’ll stay clear of obstacles.

And finally, never underestimate fatigue. Rest before you need to, not after. The river rewards awareness more than strength.`,

    nagaratitle: 'Weather and Water',
    nagaraarticle: `Mountains create their own weather — it can shift in minutes.
A clear morning can turn to mist and thunder by noon. Always check forecasts, but also read the river itself: dark water means higher flow, scattered foam means wind change.

Cold water steals heat fast, even in summer. Dress for the water temperature, not the air. If the sky grumbles, wait it out — lightning finds rivers easily.

Patience is part of rafting. A delayed start is always safer than a rushed mistake.`,

    nagaratitle: 'How to Read the River',
    nagaraarticle: `Every current speaks if you know how to listen.
Look for the “V” — where water converges between obstacles, guiding you toward the cleanest line. Avoid reversed “V” shapes; they often mark rocks or sudden drops.

Eddies — those calm pools behind rocks — are your best friend. They give rest, control, and time to plan the next move. Watch how branches or foam drift; they reveal hidden currents long before you feel them.

Learning to read a river isn’t technical — it’s sensory. You’ll feel the pull, hear the rhythm, and soon know when to let the water lead.`,

    nagaratitle: 'After the Ride',
    nagaraarticle: `The adventure doesn’t end when the boat stops.
Take a moment to walk the shore, stretch your legs, and breathe the mountain air. Wet gear dries fast in the sun, but the best thing to dry is your mind — slow down, replay the flow, remember what you learned.

If you’re with friends, share a story or a laugh. If you’re alone, listen — the forest has its own applause.
Rafting is less about the rush and more about connection — with water, air, and yourself.`,
